**riskParityPortfolio** is build on top of awesome R packages including **Rcpp**,
**RcppEigen**, **quadprog**, **alabama**, and **nloptr**. All these packages can be installed via CRAN.

### Installation

1. The **stable** version can be installed via CRAN as
```bash
install.packages("riskParityPortfolio")
```

2. The **development** version can be installed via GitHub as
```bash
devtools::install_github("dppalomar/riskParityPortfolio")
```
<small>You must have previously installed the **devtools** package.</small>
